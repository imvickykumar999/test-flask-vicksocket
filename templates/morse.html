On the other hand, some sources claim that Samuel Morse received a patent issued by an Ottoman Sultan, Abdulmejid I, for Morse Code. However, according to Cyrus Hamlin’s memoirs and The New York Times obituary published on April 3, 1872, Samuel Morse received not a patent, but an order of the Ottoman Empire, Order of Glory, instead.</h3>
